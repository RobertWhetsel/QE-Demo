# The FlexNet Family of Open Source Platforms

The FlexNet family consists of two main platforms that both utilize blockchain technology:

## FlexNet GX

A cutting-edge, serverless application ecosystem that integrates blockchain technology with modern web and mobile frontends.

Comprised of four main components:

1. **Blockchain Core:** A Rust-based blockchain implementation with One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption.
2. **Web Frontend:** A WebAssembly-powered web application built using the Yew framework.
3. **Mobile Applications:** Cross-platform mobile apps developed with the Dioxus framework.
4. **Serverless Backend:** AWS Lambda functions written in Rust, providing API endpoints.

Key features include blazing fast performance, cross-platform compatibility, scalable and cost-effective serverless architecture, modern user interfaces, and robust, type-safe application development using Rust.

Structured with separate directories for each component and provides detailed instructions for local setup, Docker-based deployment, and development guidelines.

## FlexNet JX

A JavaScript-based serverless application ecosystem that integrates blockchain technology with modern web and mobile frontends.

Comprised of three main components:

1. **Blockchain Core:** A Rust-based blockchain implementation with One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption.
2. **Web Frontend:** A JaveScript-powered web application built using FlexNet JX framework.
3. **Serverless Backend:** AWS Lambda functions written in Rust, providing API endpoints.

Both platforms demonstrate the use of modern, modular architectures to build scalable and performant applications that leverage blockchain technology. The FlexNet family showcases the versatility and power of these open source platforms in addressing a wide range of use cases.
